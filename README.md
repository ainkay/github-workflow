# 📋 Productivity Planner / To-Do App

## 🚀 Project Overview

Our goal is to build a simple yet visually appealing Productivity Planner or To-Do List App that helps users keep track of their daily tasks. By the end of the sprint, the app will be fully functional with a clean interface and an intuitive task management experience from start to finish.
